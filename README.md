##Overview

This project implements a tweet classifier that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets as either depressive or positive. The classifier processes text messages, applies tokenization, removes stop words, and utilizes either term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) or probability-based methods for classification.
